# Binder repo for Division Talk (2020 March)

Run this on Binder (free public cloud resources) using this link:

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/danielballan/division-talk/master)

Or run it on the NSLS-II JupyterHub at SDCC by visiting

https://jupyter.sdcc.bnl.gov/jupyterhub/nsls/

and choosing "division-talk".

This is used to show Jupyter using execution from a Console, execution from a
text editor attached to a Console, and from a notebook. The topics used in the
demonstration are basic parallelism, and ML techniques PCA and LDA. These
examples are adapted from dask video tutorials and scikit-learn documentation.
